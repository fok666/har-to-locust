# Har-to-Locust

Powershell script to convert browser's [HAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)) file into [Locust](https://locust.io/) load test script file.


[Transformer](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/transformer) is a better, more feature-rich tool than this simple script, but is limited to Locust 0.14.
